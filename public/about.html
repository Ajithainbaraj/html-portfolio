<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I’m Ajitha from Thanjavur. I’m studying B.E. Computer Science and Engineering (AI & ML) at KIT College.

I completed my schooling at a Government School in Ayyampettai.

I recently worked on a project called an AI-powered course platform using Python, which helps students get learning suggestions based on their progress.

I’m not very strong in coding yet, but I have a lot of interest in solving problems and learning new things.

In my free time, I enjoy listening to music.
My goal is to get placed in a good company and build a strong career in the tech field.

Thank you!</p>
